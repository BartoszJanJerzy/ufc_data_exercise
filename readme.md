# UFC Exercise

Quick #datascience exercise on data from nearly 700 #UFC events 👊  

They say that #MMA is an unpredictable sport. Sounds like a great challenge!  

🏆 I found fighter characteristics that predict their win or loss:  
- Fight action stats (e.g., significant strikes, takedowns)  
- Record-related stats (e.g., winning streak)  

🏆 I trained an LGBM model to predict fight outcomes:  
- Target 0/1 as win/loss  
- Accuracy ~72%  

🏆 I tested a neural network using the #SiameseNeuralNetwork strategy
